#LINUX/UNIX

- LINUX is a clone of UNIX (it is the free version)
- Architehture independent 
- Structure:
	- **Kernal** - controls the computer resources and schedules jobs
	- **Shell** - Command interpreter in chief
	- **Commands** - comprehensive set of inbuilt utilities that are universally required by Linux/Unix administrators & users. 
	- **Programs/ scripts/ executables** - variable number of user/programmer defined utilities that are developed for specific tasks such as bioinformatics analysis or document processing 

- /bin/ is short for binary, this is where the compiled files are 
- /dev/ device files
- /etc/ congiguration files
- /lib/ essential shred libraries 
- /mnt/ temporarily mounted filesystems
- /opt/ add-on application software packages (third party software)


#Working in Shell

- fg - foreground
- bg - background 
- logging into wildcat unix shell 
- exit - leave a shell
