#Queue method
- first in first out



		initial_list = [input_seq]
		first
- reason using queue is because order is important
- insert (add something to queue) and pop (grabs last one)


		initial_list = 
		
#objects
- can use these to create multiple instances at one time
	- output files and input files are both files  
- class file: 
	- self.header = ''
- file.header = "can change this"	
- zip and file 
- any time you see a . , it's an object 	
- inheritance 
	
		class MyFile(File) #capilize object per convention
			#use File as a parent for MyFile 
			
- can import classes just like functions
